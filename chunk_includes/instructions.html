<b>Instructions</b>
</p>

<p>
In the experiment, you will read sequences of English words and then be asked to recall them.  Each sequence will be automatically presented to you one word at a time in the center of the screen.  Before every sequence, you will see a plus sign to help you focus on the right part of the screen.  
</p>


<p>
After you have seen the whole sequence, the last word will disappear and you will be prompted to recall what you just saw by typing it into a text box.  Try to recall sequences in order if you can, but if not, just try to put down all the words you remember.  You do not need to include the plus sign in your response.
</p>
 
<p>The pace at which words will be presented to you may seem fast at first, but it is actually calibrated to the rate at which you would read normally. Most people adjust with a little practice. You will start with several practice trials to get you used to the experiment.   Note: Please read each sequence silently to yourself. Do not read out loud!</b>
</p>

  <p>
To ensure that you can see all of the words you will read, please maximize your browser screen now.
